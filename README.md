# solo-builder
## Quick start guide
You may find the following "quick start" guide useful.  You can find the [Open Solo Quick Start Guide](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/solo-opensolo-quickstart.html) on ardupilot.org.

## Using vagrant

Works in [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), typically useful for local builds.
First install this plugin:
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-guest_ansible
$ vagrant up
```

(If `vagrant up` fails, run `vagrant provision` to try provisioning your VM
again.)

To fire off the builder:

```
$ vagrant ssh -c /vagrant/builder.sh
```


## Using docker

DOCKER IS UNTESTED OUTSIDE 3DR , USE VAGRANT FOR NOW.
 
Works in Docker and boot2docker. 
Copy `id_rsa` and `solo-builder.pem` to this directory (sorry). Then run

```
docker build -t 3drobotics/solo-builder .
```

Then run

```
docker run -i 3drobotics/solo-builder su -l ubuntu /solo-build/builder.sh
```

TODO: write a script that gets the files off after

## Using something else

`playbook.yml` is an ansible file for an Ubuntu 14.04 distro. `builder.sh` is the build script for a user named `ubuntu`. Make it happen!
